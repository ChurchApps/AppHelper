# NotificationService 404 Error Fix

## Problem
The NotificationService was attempting to access `/notifications` endpoint which resulted in:
```
GET http://localhost:8086/notifications 404 (Not Found)
```

## Root Cause
After examining the MessagingApi codebase, I found that:
- ❌ `/notifications` endpoint doesn't exist (returns 404)
- ✅ `/notifications/unreadCount` is the correct endpoint for getting counts
- ✅ `/notifications/my` exists for getting all user notifications

## Solution

### Optimized Implementation
The fix uses the `/notifications/unreadCount` endpoint which returns both notification and PM counts in a single API call:

```typescript
// Before: Wrong endpoint + 2 API calls
const notifications = await ApiHelper.get("/notifications", "MessagingApi"); // 404!
const privateMessages = await ApiHelper.get("/privateMessages", "MessagingApi");

// After: Correct endpoint + 1 API call
const counts = await ApiHelper.get("/notifications/unreadCount", "MessagingApi");
// Returns: { notificationCount: number, pmCount: number }
```

### With Fallback Support
The implementation includes fallback logic for backward compatibility:

1. **Primary Method**: Use `/notifications/unreadCount` for both counts
2. **Fallback Method**: If unavailable, use `/privateMessages` for PM count only
3. **Error Handling**: Gracefully handle missing endpoints without breaking the UI

## Benefits

### Performance Improvement
- **Before**: 2 API calls (one failing with 404)
- **After**: 1 API call that succeeds
- **50% reduction** in API requests

### Reliability
- No more 404 errors in console
- Graceful degradation if endpoints change
- Silent fallback without user disruption

## MessagingApi Endpoints Reference

### Available Notification Endpoints:
- `GET /notifications/unreadCount` - Get both notification and PM unread counts
- `GET /notifications/my` - Get all notifications for current user (marks as read)
- `POST /notifications/` - Create new notification
- `POST /notifications/create` - Create notifications for multiple people

### Available Private Message Endpoints:
- `GET /privateMessages` - Get all private messages (used in fallback)
- `GET /privateMessages/:id` - Get specific private message
- `POST /privateMessages` - Send new private message

## Testing

The fix eliminates the 404 error while maintaining all functionality:
1. Open browser developer console
2. Navigate to any page that loads notification counts
3. **✅ Expected**: No 404 errors in Network tab
4. **✅ Expected**: Notification badges show correct counts
5. **✅ Expected**: Single successful request to `/notifications/unreadCount`

## Files Modified
- `NotificationService.ts` - Fixed endpoint URL and added optimized loading strategy

The fix is fully backward compatible and improves performance by reducing API calls from 2 to 1 while eliminating the 404 error.
